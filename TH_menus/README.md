# Overview

This project was one that I decided to pick up so I could improve my capabilities in learning foreign concepts. I recognized that I needed to get better at frontend work as a software engineer. This is why I decided to push my limits and make a main menu prototype for a game in Unreal Engine 5.

The main menu prototype can use mouse and keyboard or a gamepad to interact with it. There are three buttons on the menu. Level select, options, and quit. the buttons change collor when hovered over and when clicked. The quit game button is fully functional and loads up another menu that asks the user if they really want to quit, the user can then select yes or no. If the user selects no, it takes them back to the original main menu. If the user selects yes, the game will exit.

My purpose in writing this software is to become better acquanited with making GUI's in Unreal Engine 5. In this case I am collaborating on a game called trophy hoard and wanted to make a prototype menu in preparation for when I make the main menu for the game.
