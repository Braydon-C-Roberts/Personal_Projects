# Overview

As a software engineer I am wanting to be able to broaden my horizons and get more experience in various languages. This will alllow me to further prepare for any projects I work on in the future.

To demonstrate the C++ language I wrote C++ software that allows the user to keep track of their food inventory. The user interacts with it via a terminal that displays various options. When they add an item the program either writes to an existing file or creates a new file in the same directory to store the data.

I made this software not only to learn how to code in the C++ programming language, but I wanted to create a system I can use to keep inventory of the food items I buy so I can make sure I use up each item before it spoils and know when to buy more of a certain item.

# Development Environment

I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2020 community edition in the creation of this program.

The language used is C++ and used the iostream, fstream, sstream, map, cstudio, string, and windows.h libraries.

# Future Work

- Ability to sort items by expiration date.
- Shopping list file.
- Have items removed from shopping list when they are added to inventory.
- GUI to make the program more user friendly.
